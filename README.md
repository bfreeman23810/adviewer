Standalone Java Viewer for EPICS areaDetector package and MJPEG streams

Depenencies:
ij.jar // ImageJ library
camboloza.jar // for MPJPEG streams
caj.jar // EPICS java support
jca.jar // EPICS java support



This package is a work in progress ..... I have much work left to do.....so use at your own risk.

Purpupose: 
The purpose of this package is to have a stand alone application viewer for the EPICs areaDector package. 
The original idea stemmed from Mark Rivers's ImageJ Viewer. I have since supported the use of MJPEG streams using
camboloza. 

I will continue to document as I progress.... this package is not ready yet for release.
